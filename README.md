## Trustless Liquidity Pool ##

In a nutshell: You run a program that places NBT and BTC orders on an exchange at 1 USD with a very small spread. The program will send proofs of those orders to a server which in turn pays you interest in the form of NuBits.


Participating in the NuPool has several risks:

- **Hedging:** Traders might be able to successfully hedge against you. This means that people speculate an the BTC price movement and buy NBT from you at a low price and sell them back to you when the price is high (or vice versa).

- **Exchange Default:** This means that the exchange itself might cease the operation and won't return the customers funds. A situation like this has happened many times in the past (most prominently on BTER a while ago). 

- **Connection Issues:** If you are running an automated trading bot then it requires a stable internet connection to perform actions. If your internet is suddenly broken, or your computer restarts without closing the client software correctly, then there might be open orders left on the exchange which won't get closed until the connection is reestablished.

**Important:** The pool operators are never in control of your funds and are not responsible for any financial loss that might occur because of any reason whatsoever. Taking these risks is what you are getting compensated for. Please make sure that you understand what kind of service you are providing during participation and don't use any money you can not afford to lose.
